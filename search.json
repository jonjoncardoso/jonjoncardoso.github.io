We want to explore the practical applications of Generative AI tools for education and understand how they might specifically enhance (or hurt) programming skills and critical thinking. We will design exercises and learning materials and test them on several undergraduate and a graduate course at LSE this coming academic year.\nYou can read more about it on the dedicated website here.\n\n\nProject: ‘Can Large Language Models replace traditional text mining workflow?’\nA summer research project inspired by the reading of Meng 2021.\nCollaborators:\n\nJoint research with Prof. Ken Benoit.\nResearch Assistant: Terry Zhou (BSc in Politics and Data Science, LSE)\nCloud Computing Support: Jinshuai Ma\n\n\n\nProject: Course Selection Pathways at LSE\nA dataviz project to visualise and understand how students choose and navigate through their optional courses at LSE.\nCurrent collaborators:\n\nEllen Austin (Senior Data Analyst at LSE)\nPrakrit Jayakumar (LSE BSc in Econ 2nd Year) and\nEthan Virtudazo (LSE General Course Student from Japan).\n\nPast collaborators:\n\nBen Steiner\nMike Christodoulou\n\n\n\nProject: Emojis and Political Identities\nWhat can the emojis you use in your social media profile reveal about your political values? 🤔\nRead more about this project and preliminary findings here\nCo-authors:\n\nSara Luxmoore (PhD student at UC Berkeley)\nPedro Ramaciotti (Research Scientist @ médialab Sciences Po)\n\n\n\nVIMuRe\nYou can read about VIMuRe on paper recently published at JRSS A (De Bacco et al. 2023: “Latent Network Models to Account for Noisy, Multiply Reported Social Network Data.”\n\nI am writing tutorials and maintaining the VIMuRe packages in R and Python.\n🗣️ At the end of June 2023, I will be in Portland, Oregon for the Sunbelt 2023, teaching a workshop about VIMuRe alongside Daniel Redhead & Elly Power"
