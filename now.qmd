Things I am involved in now [^1]:

## 📊 **Research**:

### Project: 'Can Large Language Models replace traditional text mining workflow?'

A summer research project inspired by the reading of [Meng 2021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09271). 

Collaborators:

- Joint research with Prof. [Ken Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net/).
- Research Assistant: [Terry Zhou](github.com/tz1211) (BSc in Politics and Data Science, LSE)
- Cloud Computing Support: [Jinshuai Ma](github.com/Mayazure)
 

### Project: Course Selection Pathways at LSE

A dataviz project to visualise and understand how students choose and navigate through their optional courses at LSE. 

Current collaborators:

- [Ellen Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-austin-886a03a/) (Senior Data Analyst at LSE)
- [Prakrit Jayakumar](https://github.com/prakritj) (LSE BSc in Econ 2nd Year) and
- [Ethan Virtudazo](https://github.com/ethanvirtudazo) (LSE General Course Student from Japan).

Past collaborators:

- [Ben Steiner](https://github.com/BSteiner1)
- [Mike Christodoulou](https://github.com/mdc2002)

### Project: Emojis and Political Identities

What can the emojis you use in your social media profile reveal about your political values? 🤔

- [Pedro Ramaciotti](https://pedroramaciotti.github.io/) (Research Scientist @ médialab Sciences Po)

### VIMuRe

You can read about VIMuRe on paper recently published at JRSS A ([De Bacco et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac004): "_Latent Network Models to Account for Noisy, Multiply Reported Social Network Data._"

- I am writing tutorials and maintaining the [VIMuRe](https://latentnetworks.github.io/vimure/) packages in R and Python.
- 🗣️ At the end of June 2023, I will be in Portland, Oregon for the [**Sunbelt 2023**](https://www.insna.org/events/sunbelt-2023), teaching a workshop about `VIMuRe` alongside [Daniel Redhead](https://github.com/danielredhead ) & [Elly Power](https://github.com/eapower)  

## 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching**:

On top of that:

- In July 2023, I will teach a Summer School course about data engineering in R at LSE ([ME204 — Data Engineering for the Social World](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/summer-schools/summer-school/courses/research-methods/me204))

- I have been working on [quarto-template-for-university-courses](https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/quarto-template-for-university-courses) for my upcoming undergraduate courses at LSE in 2023/24.


- 📖 I might be working on a _textbook_ too...
