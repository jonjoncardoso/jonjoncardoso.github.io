Things I am involved in now [^1]:

## 📊 **Research**:

### Project: GENIAL - GEN<font color='#D55816'>IA</font>L: <font color='#D55816'>GEN</font>erative <font color='#D55816'>AI</font> Tools as a Catalyst for <font color='#D55816'>L</font>earning

<img src="images/GENIAL_favicon.png"  style="object-fit: cover;width:8em;height:8em;border-radius: 70%;"/>

A focus group led by my colleague, Dr [Marcos Barreto](https://marcosebarreto.github.io/) ([LSE Department of Statistics](https://lse.ac.uk/statistics)), and I. We want to explore the practical applications of Generative AI tools for education and understand how they might specifically enhance (or hurt) programming skills and critical thinking. We will design exercises and learning materials and test them on several undergraduate and a graduate course at LSE this coming academic year.

You can read more about it on the dedicated website [here](http://lse-dsi.github.io/genial).

### Project: 'Can Large Language Models replace traditional text mining workflow?'

A summer research project inspired by the reading of [Meng 2021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09271). 

Collaborators:

- Joint research with Prof. [Ken Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net/).
- Research Assistant: [Terry Zhou](https://github.com/tz1211) (BSc in Politics and Data Science, LSE)
- Cloud Computing Support: [Jinshuai Ma](https://github.com/Mayazure)
 

### Project: Course Selection Pathways at LSE

A dataviz project to visualise and understand how students choose and navigate through their optional courses at LSE. 

Current collaborators:

- [Ellen Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-austin-886a03a/) (Senior Data Analyst at LSE)
- [Prakrit Jayakumar](https://github.com/prakritj) (LSE BSc in Econ 2nd Year) and
- [Ethan Virtudazo](https://github.com/ethanvirtudazo) (LSE General Course Student from Japan).

Past collaborators:

- [Ben Steiner](https://github.com/BSteiner1)
- [Mike Christodoulou](https://github.com/mdc2002)

### Project: Emojis and Political Identities

What can the emojis you use in your social media profile reveal about your political values? 🤔

### VIMuRe

You can read about VIMuRe on paper recently published at JRSS A ([De Bacco et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac004): "_Latent Network Models to Account for Noisy, Multiply Reported Social Network Data._"

- I am writing tutorials and maintaining the [VIMuRe](https://latentnetworks.github.io/vimure/) packages in R and Python.
- 🗣️ At the end of June 2023, I will be in Portland, Oregon for the [**Sunbelt 2023**](https://www.insna.org/events/sunbelt-2023), teaching a workshop about `VIMuRe` alongside [Daniel Redhead](https://github.com/danielredhead ) & [Elly Power](https://github.com/eapower)  

## 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching**:

- I just finished teaching Summer School course about data engineering in R at LSE ([ME204 — Data Engineering for the Social World](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/summer-schools/summer-school/courses/research-methods/me204)).

- I have been preparing material for the upcoming academic year at LSE. Courses I taught recently:

On top of that:

- I have been working on [quarto-template-for-university-courses](https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/quarto-template-for-university-courses) for my upcoming undergraduate courses at LSE in 2023/24.


- 📖 I might be working on a _textbook_ too...
